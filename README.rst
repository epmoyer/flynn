Flynn

Overview
========

Flynn is a vector graphics gaming framework for Javascript.
It began life as an adaptation of Max Wihlborg's excellent "Asteroids" Javascript tutorial
(https://github.com/maxwihlborg/youtube-tutorials) for the game "Roundabout" in Ludum Mini-Dare #56
(http://ludumdare.com/compo/minild-56/?action=preview&uid=49069), and was then refined into a stand-alone
framework for use in future games.

I've posted this first release with intent to use it in Ludum Dare 32.  As of this writing I haven't yet
released the final version of Roundabout (which now uses Flynn), and I haven't yet developed a demo app to 
show/test the capabilities of Flynn.  Both are coming some time after Dare 32.
